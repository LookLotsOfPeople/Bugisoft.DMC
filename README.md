# Bugisoft.DMC

<h1>Instructions For Use</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository inside of preferably empty folder. I Strongly recomend placing it in /home/bugisoft/ as I have used this for my testing. Logs will be placed in this spot, so be warned.</li>
<li>Edit credentials.txt and place the bot token inside the empty ' '.</li>
<li>Run the bot by doing "python3 Bugisoft.DMC". I strongly recomend doing this from the /home/bugisoft/ folder and not the actual folder due to the fact that logs generate in /home/bugisoft/logs/ and not inside the Bugisoft.DMC folder.</li>
</ol>
